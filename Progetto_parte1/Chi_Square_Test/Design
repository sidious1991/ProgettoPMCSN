- Choosen Test: Test of Uniformity based on Chi-Square statistic:
  - Test the (a,m) = (48271, 2^31 - 1)
  - 256, one for stream
  - k >= 1000 & n >= 10*k
  - Put alfa = 0.005
 
- Compute Chi-Square statistic V over all stream:
  - Plot resulting point and evaluate the failure or the success of the generator using the critical value V1* and V2*
    (Done by R-Statistics and Scatterplot)

- Compile file chisquare.c and run --> creation of file "data" with 256 Chi-Square statistics and v1*,v2* at the tail of file.
